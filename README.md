Face Mask Detection

Face mask detection is an object detection task that detects whether people are wearing masks or not in videos. This repo includes a demo for building a face mask detector using YOLOv5 model.

So in this assignment i have done the real time face detections by using YOLO and deepsort
along with the Opencv there are the steps which is followed in the process to to achieve the
image recognition
- Importing required Libraries
- Connection to the Google drive
- After that we are cloning with the Git Repo.
- And change the directory
- Install all the requirements.txt
- Then download the pre-trained weights
- Training the model of yolo using the face mask
dataset(dataset.yaml(in which i have mentioned clear address
of the train and val images) The dataset.yaml file is stored
on my drive .....and i have used the yolo weights for the
training purpose....I have upload the yolov5s.pt weights.
- Detection on new images
- used opencv for displaying the detected images (which i detect in
above cell) and this is my self
- Detection on video
- Just download the final video
- export your model's weights for future use
